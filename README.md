## What is it?

A library for creating zip files using the builder pattern.

## What are its features?

`// TODO`

## Dependencies

The library targets `netstandard1.3` and depends upon SharpZipLib 1.x.

## Example usage

`// TODO`

## Building from source

We recommend building with the `dotnet` cli, but since the package targets `netstandard1.3` and depends only on SharpZipLib 1.x, you should be able to build it in any tooling that supports those requirements.

- Have the .NET Core SDK 2.0 or newer
- `dotnet build`
- Optionally `dotnet pack`
- Reference the resulting assembly, or NuGet package.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, if you want to expose any further SharpZipLib functionality via this interface or otherwise improve things around here.

If there are issues open, please feel free to make pull requests for them, and they will be reviewed.
